    <h3>How to make instant kesar peda  : </h3>
    <ol type=1>
        <li>Heat Ghee in a wide Pan. Add Condensed Milk and Milk Powder to it and constantly stir in medium flame. Remember to break the lumps, as you stir otherwise the peda might not have the desired smooth finish. In about 8-10 minutes the mixture will come together. At this stage, add the Saffron infused milk and cardamom powder. The mixture will loosen again, but with another few minutes on the flame, the mixture will come together with constant stirring.</li>
        <li>Check if they are sticky on the top by pinching a small ball. If they are, stir for another 2 minutes until the mixture is not sticky.</li>
        <li>Once they do not stick, remove the pan of the flame. Turn down the mixture to a greased plate and allow it to cool down a bit.</li>
        <li>Grease your palm with ghee, pinch a small portion from the mixture and roll it into Peda shape and give a little indendation in the middle with your thumb. Garnish with silvered almonds, pistachio and saffron. When I made it for the second time, I did not have a mould either, its just a diy press that I have used to get the shape in the middle.</li>
